      These combs are un-drilled - no holes. The Marine Band 1896 is assembled with
      nails which attach the reed plates and cover plates to the comb. When retrofitting
      a Marine Band 1896 most people replace the nails with screws. If that is what
      you plan to do then you can either drill holes yourself (in the reed plates,
      comb and cover plates) using one of these un-drilled MB 1896 combs or you might
      prefer the Marine Band Deluxe combs which are pre-drilled. The combs for the

      Golden Melody is one of Hohner's most popular 10-hole diatonic harmonicas. It
      comes new \"out of the box\" with a red plastic comb. Harmonica manufacturers
      often use plastic to make combs because it lowers their cost of production.
      Plastic is also impervious to moisture, which eliminates the possibility of
      swelling or warping. However, many harmonica enthusiasts believe that the tonal
      quality of wood combs is superior to that of a plastic combs. Hohner and Suzuki
      are two of the most successful harmonica manufactures in the world. Hohner recently
      introduced a new version of the Marine Band 1896 called the Crossover. The Crossover
      is made with a laminated bamboo comb. Suzuki came out with a model called the
      Manji M-20 which is named after the founder of Suzuki Musical Instruments Manufacturing
      Co. Ltd. - Mr. Manji Suzuki. The Manji is built with a comb made from a wood/resin
      composite which looks and feels like wood. Both of these harmonicas have received
      rave reviews. The fact that these two leaders in the harmonica world have released
      new models with wood or wood composite combs suggests that regardless of what
      others might believe, Hohner and Suzuki still believe that the tonal qualities
      of wood are very desirable to harmonica enthusiasts."

      note that I have added a little extra reinforcement toward the tips of the #3

    - Aluminum SP-20 Combs
    - ! "Beautiful Precision CNC-Milled Aluminum Combs made for the Hohner Special
      20 series of harmonica.\n\nThe combs are made from 6061 aluminum and have
      been professionally anodized. These combs are fantastic creations. I'd like
      to take credit for making them but that would not be entirely accurate. I contracted
      out the milling and the anodizing because I wanted them to be professional grade
      products.\n\nThe Special 20 combs are .250” thick as it is on the stock
      comb. The stock comb on a Special 20 is an injection molded comb with a recessed
      cavity that allows the reed plates to sit down into the comb and back a little
      from the front edge of the harp. It literally forms a mouthpiece on the front
      of the harmonica. When the stock comb is replaced with a wood, acrylic or metal
      comb you will lose that mouthpiece and will create what is commonly known as
      a “Tin Sandwich”. Personally, I do not find that to be at all negative, but
      there are Special 20 Purists who absolutely hate that entire notion. There are
      usually 6 screws holding the reed plates to the comb and two additional holes
      should you want to add two more. These Special 20 combs will accommodate all
      8 screws. If you have a very old Special 20 that is made with nails, you're
      going to have to replace them with screws. If you need some screws, let me know
      and I will send them to you along with the combs."
