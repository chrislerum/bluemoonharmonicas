Blue Moon Harmonicas
====================

This is a project I created for Tom Halchak and have been maintaining for quite a while now. I essentially created a user authentication-enabled e-commerce site from scratch using Ruby on Rails. 

Original
--------
The original site is still stored [here](https://github.com/stevenpetryk/bluemoonharmonicas_php).

Purpose
-------
Tom founded Blue Moon Harmonicas, LLC to sell his custom harmonicas parts and, nowadays, his fully-assembled harmonicas.
